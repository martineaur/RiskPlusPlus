TO DO LIST FOR 12/5/2016

-cout statements for letting the user know which player is taking the turn/attacking
-error checking
-general output formatting
-when you only have 1 army in every territory, you cannot attack -> BUG
-cout that you have been given 3 armies at the beginning of each turn
-oscillation of players
-winning conditions

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Then the game will be finished, and we can try to tune up the code a bit

RYAN R's QUESTIONS:

-If you attack with one, the defending country still defends with 2?
	-If so, everything is fine
	-If not, there is an error in our logic GameBoard : line 588
	
-If you attack with 3 against 1, defense lost 1 army
	-You take over the country, and ALL 3 of your armies are moved into the new country?
